### About

I'm Stuart Freeman, if you'd like to know about my jiu jitsu career, see my [BeltChecker Profile](https://www.beltchecker.com/profile.php?id=3559). I made this site so I can easily link to tips for things that you might need before or after training. If you have any problems or suggestions feel free to [submit an issue](https://github.com/stuartf/bjjhacks/issues).

Use the navigation links at the top of the page to find the information you're looking for.
