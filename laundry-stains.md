The easiest way to avoid stains is to avoid wearing white a white gi, sometimes that's not possible or not your style though.

Chlorine bleach should only be used as a last resort, it will weaken the fabric and make it more prone to tearing.

I've had great results using oxygen bleach such as [OxiClean](https://www.oxiclean.com/en/products/stain-fighters/oxiclean-versatile-stain-remover) and [Charlie's Soap Oxygen Bleach](https://shop.charliesoap.com/oxygen-bleach-non-chlorine-bleach---264-lb-p75.aspx).

For tough set spots, particularly blood, I mix a little water with oxygen bleach to make a paste that I apply directly to the stain and let sit until dried, then wash.

Generally though I just add a scoop to the wash and use cold water, as warm is more likly to set stains.
