There are numerous ways to get the stink out of your training gear, but they all boil down to killing the microbes that are creating the smell.

I've had the best results using [OdoBan](https://odoban.com/product/multipurpose-concentrate). About 4 oz. in the fabric softener dispenser does the trick.

Other options are [PineSol](https://www.pinesol.com/products/original-pine-cleaner/) and [Clear Gear](https://cleargear.com/product/).

I've also tried white vinegar and placing a smelly rashguard in a ziplock bag in the freezer overnight. I wouldn't say either was completely ineffective, but the results were not as good.
